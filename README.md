According to Lucía Artazcoz, et al, long working hours will severely affect both people’s physical and mental health with low work efficiency. Nowadays, the fact that this world is filled with countless 
working opportunities with various working standards has gained our attention towards the working hours that vary between different people due to different reasons. Therefore we decided to use the Adult 
dataset from the 1944 Census database by Barry Becker to examine how 2 factors: sex and relationship affect people's hours per week out of 14 factors included in 
the dataset.

We will use statistical inference techniques, hypothesis testing, and bootstrapping methods with error analysis and confidence intervals to find the mean and standard deviation. We will use the results to 
evaluate and determine the significance of each factor that contributes to working hours, and help people determine the most suitable working hours for different types of people.
